# ðŸ¤– Deep Learning Module

This folder contains projects related to **deep learning** â€” from foundational implementations to applied CNN models for real-world tasks.

## Projects

### 1. **Linear Regression from Scratch** (`notebooks/linear_regression.ipynb`)  
   - Built a single-neuron linear regression model to predict Fahrenheit temperatures from Celsius inputs.  
   - Implemented gradient descent manually without high-level frameworks.  
   - Steps:
     - Data generation (160 Celsiusâ€“Fahrenheit pairs)  
     - Model initialization (random weight & bias)  
     - Forward pass (predictions + MSE loss)  
     - Backward pass (manual gradient calculation)  
     - Parameter update (gradient descent loop)  
     - Validation with trainâ€“test split  
   - Tools: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib

### 2. **Neural Network Implementation (Scratch & Keras)** (`notebooks/Neural Network Implementation from Scratch and with Keras on MNIST.ipynb`)  
   - Implemented a simple **neural network from scratch** using **NumPy** (sigmoid activation, forward & backward propagation, SGD).  
   - Trained the scratch-built model on a **small synthetic dataset** to validate learning.  
   - Preprocessed and loaded the **MNIST dataset** for digit recognition.  
   - Built and trained a **Keras-based neural network** for handwritten digit classification.  
   - Tools: Python, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras  
   - Example: trained model achieved high accuracy on MNIST with Keras implementation.

### 3. **MNIST Digit Recognition** (`notebooks/mnist_digit_recognition.ipynb`)  
   - Implemented a **CNN from scratch** for handwritten digit classification.  
   - Compared performance against a baseline MLP model.  
   - Achieved >98% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.  
   - Tools: TensorFlow, Matplotlib  
   - Example:

### 4. **CNN vs MLP Comparison** (`notebooks/cnn_vs_mlp_comparison.ipynb`)  
   - Compared performance of **Convolutional Neural Networks** vs traditional fully-connected networks.  
   - Analyzed training curves, overfitting, and generalization.  
   - Tools: TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib  
   - Example:
